# Cutter System #

The `cutter` system is made up of several different hardware units.

* `base-station`
  Provides an *anchor* for the yard.  The `base-station` will use a GPS receiver and a WiFi transmitter.  The station should be powered by batteries.  The station must be rain-water proof.  It does not need to be completely water proof (it will not be submersed in water).
* `cutter-manager`
* `cutter-unit`
* `cutter phone app`
