# Display #

This `Display` subsystem will take the information from the environment and render the yard and all contained obstacles.

Active sensors may be added to the display to provide visual feedback of what the `mower`s are 'seeing'.

This subsystem should be pretty straight forward.

The `Display` subsystem will run in its own thread/process.
